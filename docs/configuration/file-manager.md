# File Manager

`files` is used to manage files and directories in your project.

By default, `dist` and `src` directories are managed. Use the `skip` option to override.

Use [config](./config.md) to customize configurations in combination with [config-manager](../config-manager.md).

If a managed file is modified or deleted, it will be backed up and replaced with the managed file.

If `allowChanges` is enabled for a file, it is only managed if it is unchanged or removed. If a file has changed and the source file has also changed, the source file will be copied with the `-latest.ext`.

Use the `skip` option to specify an array of files/directories not to be managed. They are equal to the relative directory.

Managed files/directories will be removed when they are no longer managed.

const backtrackPaths = require('@backtrack/core/paths');

const backtrackConfig = {

    files: [
        {

            src: 'files/.eslintrc.js',

            /**

            dest: '.eslintrc.js',

            /**
